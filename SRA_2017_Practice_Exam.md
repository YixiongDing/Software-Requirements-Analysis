    - is when new requirements are added after the project has started. Often these changes are not properly reviewed. The project team is expected to deliver them with the same resources and in the same time as the original scope.

2. Waterfall:
    - To avoid the worst kinds of scope creep, a project manager should consider even minor adjustments to the original project scope carefully and rework time lines, provide new estimates and communicate with the stakeholders before integrating changes. This should filter out all but the most important concerns.

3. Agile:
    - When new changes are made by the stakeholders, the product owner should discuss the new changes and requirements with the whole scrum team and rearrange the user stories in the Product Backlog and Sprint Backlog during the Sprint Planning Meeting.
